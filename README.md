Tumblr Liked Photos Export
==========================

Export the images from your [liked posts](https://www.tumblr.com/likes) in Tumblr.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:  

        $ git clone git@github.com:javierarce/tumblr-liked-photos-export.git

2. Make sure you have bundler installed:  

        gem install bundler

3. Install dependencies:

        $ bundle install

4. Enable the option "Share posts you like" in the settings page of your blog.
        https://www.tumblr.com/settings/blog/<YOUR_BLOG>
 
5. Register a new app:  

        https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps

6. Copy the `OAuth Consumer Key` of the app.  
7. Now you have two options:

- Add two keys to your bash/zsh: 

        export TUMBLR_USERNAME="MY_FANTASTIC_TUMBLR_USERNAME"  
        export TUMBLR_API_KEY="MY_DAUNTING_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY"  

- Or simply update the `export.rb` file with your credentials:
        
        # Configuration
        username = "MY_COOL_TUMBLR_USERNAME"
        api_key  = "MY_OH_SO_NICE_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY"

## Usage

Go to the app directory and run:  

    ruby export.rb

Your favorite images from Tumblr will be downloaded to the blog folder under `images`.
Each photo is appended with the post date to make it easier to see like the blog's timeline.

Optionally, you can specify a `username` param:

    ruby export.rb username

Or a `username` and a `name` for the download directory:

    ruby export.rb username download_dir

## Output

This is what it looks like when it runs:

```
$ ruby export.rb username

URL
http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/username.tumblr.com/likes?api_key=API_KEY

USERNAME
username

DIR
images

## Rate limits

Newly registered consumers are rate limited to 1,000 requests per hour, and 5,000 requests per day. If your application requires more requests for either of these periods, you'll need request a rate limit removal on the app (there's a link for that in the app directory page).

## Troubleshooting

- If you get the an `Unauthorized` error message, open the URL http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/USERNAME.tumblr.com/likes?api_key=API_KEY in your browser (replacing USERNAME and API_KEY with your own values). You should see a list of posts.

- If you get the error `cannot load such file -- httparty`, use `gem` to install dependencies.

- It seems that old keys (before the Automattic era?) always return an `Unauthorized` errorâ€¦ the solution for this problem is to create a new app.
